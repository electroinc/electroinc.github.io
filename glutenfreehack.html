			<p>For some people the Gluten-Free (GF) Lifestyle (GFL) is a fashion choice (FC). But for others, it is not (NGFLFC). For those who are NGFLFC, this article will explain a trick I have learned that results in home-baked goods (HBG) being much lighter and less stodgy than most GF recipes.</p>
			<image src="nowheat.gif" title="NO WHEAT = GF" />
			<p>The trick is to divide your eggs after you crack them. Ie, put the yolks in the batter mix, and put the whites into a separate CLEAN bowl. You should then whisk the egg whites until they make soft peaks, much like a meringue. Then, FOLD in the egg whites to the batter mix (do not mix or you will beat out the air and the HBG will not turn out as well). The HBG can then be processed as per the existing recipe.</p>
			<p>And that's the hack! Of course for some this is just a tip in their GFLFC, but for NGFLFC, this simple trick will make the texture of your HBG resemble that of non-GF foodstuffs that you were probably eating before.</p>
